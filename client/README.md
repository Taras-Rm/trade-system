### DB:

### Firebase was used as a database. Firebase is a platform for developing mobile and web applications.

### I have already used this database in previous laboratory works (reference to the pull request where the database connection occurred https://github.com/Taras-Rm/cstd-romaniuktaras-2122/pull/2). The connection to the database takes place in a firebase.js file. Interaction with the database takes place in reducers files (appReducer.js, authReducer.js, goodsReducer.js).

### The database has the following tables (collections):

- #### users - table for storing information about each registered user
- #### goods - table for storage of all goods sold
- #### buyedGoods - table for storage of all purchased goods
- #### selledGoods - table for storage of all buyed goods

#### New tag: trade_v3.0_17_23174

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
